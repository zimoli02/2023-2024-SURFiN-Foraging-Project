# 2023-2024-SURFiN-Foraging-Project

This project aims to utilise advanced statistical methods to analyze naturalistic, long-duration mouse foraging behaviour.

## Mouse kinematics data inference: Background Knowledge

We use theories from linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the kinematics of mouse moving. The [DKBook](/DKBook) and [BishopBook](/BishopBook) folders contain my notes while reading these two books to learn LDS. Each includes some figures reproduced from the book along with their corresponding scripts and some equation derivation notes.

## Statistical Analysis in the Project
See [Scripts](/Scripts) used in the project.

## Figures Presented in the SURFiN Symposium Poster
See [Poster](/Poster) that contains scripts and notebooks for figure reproduction.
