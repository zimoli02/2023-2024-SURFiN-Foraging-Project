# 2023-2024-SURFiN-Foraging-Project

This project aims to utilise advanced statistical methods to analyze long-term mouse foraging behaviour in an open arena.

## Mouse kinematic data analysis: Background Knowledge

We use theories from linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the kinematics of mouse moving. The [DKBook](/DKBook) and [BishopBook](/BishopBook) folders contain my notes while reading these two books to learn LDS. Each includes some figures reproduced from the book along with their corresponding scripts and some equation derivation notes.
