/nfs/nhome/live/zimol/ProjectAeon/aeon_mecha/Functions/inference.py:225: UserWarning: The use of `x.T` on tensors of dimension other than 2 to reverse their shape is deprecated and it will throw an error in a future release. Consider `x.mT` to transpose batches of matrices or `x.permute(*torch.arange(x.ndim - 1, -1, -1))` to reverse the dimensions of a tensor. (Triggered internally at ../aten/src/ATen/native/TensorShape.cpp:3614.)
